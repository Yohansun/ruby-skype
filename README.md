Skype Public API for Ruby
=========================

This library is a binding for the [Skype Public API][skype-api]. Currently,
due to the Skype API being accessed in different ways on different platforms
this library will initially only be supported on Linux/DBus.

**This is very much still under development**

If you want to use this or help out, please feel free to clone/fork and play
with this, but it is prone to break or change at any time.
